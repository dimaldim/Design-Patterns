# Abstract Factory Pattern

## Overview
The Abstract Factory pattern is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

## Implementation Details
The `VehicleFactory` interface in this example defines methods for creating different types of vehicles. `LuxuryVehicleFactory` and `StandardVehicleFactory` are concrete factories that implement these methods to create specific types of vehicles.

## Key Points
- Helps in creating a set of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.
- Encourages consistency among products created.
- Supports adding new families of products.

## Usage
The client code can work with any concrete factory it needs, without depending on the concrete classes of the products it creates:

```java
VehicleFactory luxuryFactory = new LuxuryVehicleFactory();
Car luxuryCar = luxuryFactory.createCar();
Truck luxuryTruck = luxuryFactory.createTruck();

VehicleFactory standardFactory = new StandardVehicleFactory();
Car standardCar = standardFactory.createCar();
Truck standardTruck = standardFactory.createTruck();
